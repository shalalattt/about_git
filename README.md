# about_git
example:
release/v1.1.0 finished
code in release/v1.1.0 combined into develop and master automatically
feature/newFunc_by_v1.1.0 is created by develop;
hotfix/v1.1.1 finished
code in hotfix/v1.1.1 combined into develop and master automatically

this moment newFunc_by_v1.1.0 still contains any bug debuged in v1.1.1, but it doesn't matter,
because the key reason is that feature and master still debuged that bug contained in newFunc_by_v1.1.0 when feature/newFunc_by_v1.1.0 finished.
